## Agenda
* SDCFlows:
    * Walk-through the new notebook: https://github.com/nipreps/sdcflows/pull/285
* CircleCI:
    * Burning through CircleCI credits. >200k in August 17-September 16. Likely to hit 120k by this meeting (~10k/day). Storage costs dominating, might need to reconsider docker/derivatives caching strategy. [CJM]
* Container maintainability
    * Nipreps docker images seem brittle. Consider reducing scope of conda environment to compiled numerical packages only, leave all pure Python packages to pip.
    * LTS container build resolvable with an `environment.yml`. Is this the way we want to go in general, with a clear strategy for updating?
* Project updates
    * fMRIPrep fit/confounds/apply mode: CJM starting work
    * migas incorporation - held up by GCP migration
