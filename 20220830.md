# Notes

Attendees: @mgxd, @effigies, @eilidhmacnicol, @celprov, @oesteban.

We followed the ordering in [the project](https://github.com/orgs/nipreps/projects/7/views/1).

## fMRIPrep

The main target now is releasing again.
This is blocked by SDCFlows, so we just jumped in.

## SDCFlows
- CI/CD is broken now:
  - @effigies will post the python package manually
  - @oesteban will figure out how to fix the problem of datalad unable to pull down data from OSF.
- We reviewed a few fMRIPrep issues regarding very wrong results of SDC.
- EMN will post an issue to detail the bottlenecks with rodents.
  She proposes to set-up some pair programming session to better understand if she's taking the right directions.
  OE will make himself available next week for that.
  
## NiWorklows
- Held by a problem of nipype with traits latest release.
  Nipype discussion pushed to the end

## sMRIPrep
- We discussed briefly what it would take to integrate SynthStrip, but the issue is not urgent at all and will probably not have attention for the moment.

## MRIQC
- OE showed the new rating widgets and summarized some of the recent and future lines
- EMN noted her latest PR about visualizations, and requested feedback on how to implement the interface to select the species specific workflows.

## NiBabies
- MG presented the latest news:
  - migas integration
  - error reporting for migas is in the plans
- One bug was fixed

## fMRIPrep-rodents
- It's a bit on the back-burner, waiting for advance on other fronts (mainly, SDCFlows).

## migas
- It will be moved to the nipreps org.
- MG is considering how to deploy the server, as heroku is leaning towards paid-only tiers.

## Final comments
- CM proposed https://github.com/orgs/nipreps/projects/6/views/2 targetting fMRIPrep releases.
  He will merge the metadata and we will have just one project.
